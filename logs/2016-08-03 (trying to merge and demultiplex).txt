# Count the number of reads in each of the demultiplexed fastq files:

# Make directory to hold results:
mkdir ../results/2_general_info/

# Count the number of reads in the demultiplexed files:
./count_reads_in_original_fastq_files_JA14814.sh

# Save summary table and plot of the number of reads per file:
./summarize_reads_per_sample.R 

# Create table of the sample names, file names, and barcodes (since the sequencing center didn't sent us barcode information):
./pull_barcode_info_from_sequencing_files.R \
	--seq_path=../data/raw/sequencing_data/JA16414/ \
	--out=../data/processed/1_general_sample_info/table_barcodes_JA16414.txt

# Multiple samples have the same barcode, so can't smoosh all the files together

# First, source qiime_bash on cbsuley:
source qiime_bash

# Instead, try multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py:
multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py \
	-i ../data/raw/sequencing_data/JA16414 \
	-o ../data/processed/QIIME/1_split_libraries \
	--demultiplexing_method sampleid_by_file \
	
# Just kidding, need to merge paired end reads first

# Run R script to create script that will merge paired end reads:
